**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* main.py containing the script to create/load and train the model.
* src/model.py containing the Model class which initializes or loads a model from a h5 file and also trains the model.
* src/session_handler.py which reads the driving log file and loads all the images and measurements.
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode.
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network.
* writeup/writeup.md

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

Note: The driving speed has been increased from 9mph to 30mph to make the testing of the models slightly less tedious.

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The src/model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.
The src/session_handler.py file contains the code for reading the training date generated by the simulator.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

The used model is based on the Nvidia model with the addition of a normalization layer (src/model.py@11) and a dropout layer (src/model.py@19)

```python
    model.add(Cropping2D(cropping=((70, 25), (0, 0))))
    model.add(Convolution2D(24, 5, 2, activation="relu"))
    model.add(Convolution2D(36, 5, 2, activation="relu"))
    model.add(Convolution2D(48, 5, 2, activation="relu"))
    model.add(Convolution2D(64, 3, activation="relu"))
    model.add(Convolution2D(64, 3, activation="relu"))
    model.add(Dropout(0.3))
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(100))
    model.add(Dense(50))
    model.add(Dense(10))
    model.add(Dense(1))
```

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (src/model.py@19).

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting; the validation set was picked out of the training data using the validation_split option while fitting the model.

```python
    self.model.fit(x, y, validation_split=validation_split, shuffle=shuffle, epochs=5)
```

The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (src/model.py line 25).

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. A combination of the following driving scenarios was used to collect data: centerline driving and centerline driving in the opposite direction.

For details about how the training data was created, see the next section.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

As was done on the previous project, the first attempt was performed using the LeNet5 network. After repeated failures with this model the Nvidia model recommended in the project materials was also tried out. Since this model was used in real world scenarios it was a good candidate for this use-case.


In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. To prevent overfitting however a dropout layer was added.

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. After the first attempt the vehicle was crossing the bridge but driving off the dirt road to the right. This first model was taken as the starting point and additional training data was collected.

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes

| Layer (type) | Output Shape |
|:---:|:---:|
| Normalization (Lambda) | (None, 160, 320, 3) |
| Cropping (Cropping2D) | (None, 65, 320, 3) |
| Convolutional (Conv2D) | (None, 31, 158, 24) |
| Convolutional (Conv2D) | (None, 14, 77, 36) |
| Convolutional (Conv2D) | (None, 5, 37, 48) |
| Convolutional (Conv2D) | (None, 3, 35, 64) |
| Convolutional (Conv2D) | (None, 1, 33, 64) |
| Dropout (Dropout) | (None, 1, 33, 64) |
| Flatten (Flatten) | (None, 2112) |
| Fully connected (Dense) | (None, 100) |
| Fully connected (Dense) | (None, 50) |
| Fully connected (Dense) | (None, 10) |
| Fully connected (Dense) | (None, 1) |

Here is a visualization of the architecture as produced by Keras.

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded one lap on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][center_center]

The left and right camera images were also included; the steering measurement was modified with a bias towards the opposite direction to cause the vehicle to steer towards the center.

![alt text][left_center]
![alt text][right_center]

One additional training set was generated by driving the vehicle in the opposite direction in the hopes of improving the training data. The track has a clear bias towards the left.

![alt text][left_reverse]
![alt text][center_reverse]
![alt text][right_reverse]

After the collection process, I had 24783 data points. I then preprocessed this data by normalizing and cropping.

I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. All done via the keras fit function arguments validation_split and shuffle.

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
